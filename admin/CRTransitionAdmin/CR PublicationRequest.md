the Director's approval is in:

	@@@@@

The documents are as follows
----------------------------

Web Annotation Data Model
http://www.w3.org/TR/2016/CR-annotation-model-20160705/

Web Annotation Vocabulary
http://www.w3.org/TR/2016/CR-annotation-vocab-20160705/

Web Annotation Protocol
http://www.w3.org/TR/2016/CR-annotation-protocol-20160705/

Abstract and Status Sections
----------------------------

See the previous URL-s

The documents are already in place and pass the new pubrules' checker (ie, specberus).

The link checker has a number of problems with the Web Annotation Vocabulary document, however, those are problems with the checker and not the document itself. Indeed, there are a number of errors reported on RDF term URL-s, in the RDF, RDF Schema, or Dublin Core namespaces. Those are valid RDF URI-s, although they are not dereferencable (they are not part of HTML document), which messes up the link checker. These namespaces are:

http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns
http://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams
http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema

There are also a number of error reports related to http://purl.org/dc/; these are all dereferencable when done via a browser.


Coralie & Xueyuan: I will send a separate mail to you and comm team for the AC announcement and the HPN news.

Thanks!

Ivan
